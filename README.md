## Textual Description Of Work
| Name | Github user | Description |
|--------|--------|--------|
|Alejandro Checa Folguera | AlexCh98 |All the securityof spring boot. The log in and sign up form with their controllers. Email automatic sending when sign up and start spring boot proyect and merging the page in phase 1 with my teammates.|
|Iván Martín Sanz|  i100van |Normally tasks of use of API, application of templates Mustache, port to mySQL, and html files of matches.|
|José Luis Lavado Sánchez | lujoselu98 |Mainly task related with tournaments logic on TournamentService and display on mustache template, also logic to register team into tournament and pdf library to generate tournament ranking exportable pdf. All error handling via html for wellkonwn errors and via ``` @ControllerAdvice ``` for unexpected unhandled errors. Interceptor to generate the navbar links based on logged user. Link the player and user entity on the database at signup.|
|Lucas Gómez Torres |  LucasGomezTorres |Mainly tasks related to the player entity  such as playerController or playerService besides templating html with mustache in files as index.html or player.html, also helped on matches. |
|Daniel Carmona Pedrajas | Dacarpe03 |Mainly tasks related to the team entity such as teamController or teamService besides templating html pages with Mustache, also helped on player and admin tasks and a minor SQL query|

## Steps for making the website: 
1. Create the html template with css, js ... 
2. Create a spring project with maven and web dependencies, devtools, jpa, h2, mustache. 
3. Create in resources a static folder and another of templates. 
4. We put all our css, js, images and static elements that we already had in the static folder. 
5. We put the html in the templates folder because we will use mustache and it is the configuration that it requires. 
6. We will have to change the links to all the css, js from the html because the static address does not work, so we will have to put, for example, /css/library/bootstrap.css 
7. In the application.properties file we add: 
  a. ``` spring.mustache.suffix = .html ``` 
    i. so that mustache understands the .html files. 
  b. ``` spring.h2.console.enabled = true ```
    i. For h2 to work. 
8. We tried to make everything work. 
9. To see that the bbdd works, we load localhost: ```port / h2-console ``` and on the screen that comes out, we will have to leave everything the same changing what is in JDBC URL by jdbc: h2: mem: testdb and should connect and see the administrator of the bbdd. 
10 .The project could already be uploaded to github, because it works, even if it doesn't detect the links between html (index load only). 

### We start with the player class: 

1. We create a controller class and add the request Mapping in the controller to have the url defined. 
2. Later, we create the java class to define the entity (@Entity) in the bbdd, we put the attributes, define the id with @Id and ```java @GeneratedValue (strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)``` together with all the getters and setters and constructor (empty and with all the parameters minus id) 
3. We create a repository class of the previous entity, for example: 
  a. ```java public interface PlayerRepository extends JpaRepository <Player, Long> ```
4. Next, we create: 
  a. ```java public Optional <Player> findById (long id)  ```
    i. This method method in the PlayerRepository, so we can search for the Id from the class. 
5. To initialize the database with sample data we have Application implement ApplicationRunner. We add an @Autowired from each repository and initialize the values in the main method using the save method of the repository. 
6. An example we are talking about is: 
 ```java
      @GetMapping("/{id}")  
      public String player(Model model, @PathVariable Long id){  
              Optional<Player> player = playerRepository.findById(id);  
              if (player.isPresent()) {  
                  model.addAttribute("name", player.get().getUsername());  
                  return "player";  
              } else {  
                  return "404";  
              }  
      }  
```
This is what we have done with the rest of the classes to generate our bbdd scheme. 

### Highlighting the creation of security: 

  You have to add the security dependency to the pom, and after that, define a class where you set the privileges for the different roles, and the restricted pages based on each role. In addition, to specifying how to log in, and the methods that will manage this, the logout... Finally, it would be necessary to create the keystore (certificate) that is what will accredit the https page, and add in the application properties server.ssl.key-store = classpath: keystore.jks, server.ssl.key-store-password = password and server.ssl.key-password = secret 

Once everything is configured, what we will do is create the necessary queries to load our information on the page, which will be done in a java class called repository, and where each sentence will be preceded by @Query, indicating that it is a query, being an example the following: 
```java
      @Query (value = 
      "SELECT m. *" + 
      "FROM tournament_matches tm" + 
      "INNER JOIN tournament t ON tm.tournament_id = t.id" + 
      "INNER JOIN games m ON tm.matches_id = m.id" + 
      "WHERE NOT played and t.name =? 1", 
      nativeQuery = true) 
      List <Match> findNotPlayedByTournamentName (String name); 
```
Later, we will make the change from h2 to mysql, adding the dependency of mysql to the pom and removing the h2, and adding in the application properties the url, username and pass of access to the bbdd. 
Finally, if you want you can add CSRF to avoid this type of attacks, deleting in the security configuration class the line crsf.disable (); and adding in all html where there is a form the following: <input type = "hidden" name = "_ csrf" value = "{{token}}" />. In addition to a CSRF Handler class that handles the configuration. 
As we said, all this page was done with mustache, html, css, java and javascript, in addition to spring boot and Maven.

## Demo Structure
1. Open Index.html and show all in it
2. Go to matches for consulting info of next matches
3. Go to teams and show ajax functionality
4. Go to Ranking and use save PDF
5. Go to registration tournament
6. Use sign up functionality and fill all the fields and upload a image
7. Show email fuctionality.
8. Log in.
9. Go again to registration tournament an fill the fields.
10. Show the ranking of the tournament.
11. On the ranking select the first teams, to show the graphics.
12. On the main bar, got to your profile, and change your image.
13. Log out and log in with the admin password: adminpass
14. Add a new match with the team we have made before.
15. Go to matches and show the match have been added.
16. Return to admin page and fill the data of that match.
17. Go to the ranking and show the consecuences, thats our advance consulting.
18. Go to matches and show the match is change from next matches to last matches, and go into the match overview and show that it have the data we have fill.
19. Then go to the team and show that the statistics have change.

 ## Changes:
### Complementary technology
* API from GoogleCalendar to be able to show the matches loaded from the database has been changed by the generation of a pdf with the data of a tournament.
* Emails sent to the players as a remainder of the game has been changed by an email sent when user create a new account.
* Login with facebook, twitter or google changed by a twitter collection in main page.
### Advanced Algorithms
The ELO system has been replaced by the calculation of the ranking in each update made by the admin of the games played, and advanced querys to fill the data such as:
```java
   @Query(value = "SELECT m.* " +
            "FROM tournament_matches AS tm " +
            "INNER JOIN tournament t ON tm.tournament_id = t.id " +
            "INNER JOIN(" +
            "SELECT id, date, played, stadistics_1_id, stadistics_2_id " +
            "FROM (" +
            "SELECT t.name as team_name , g.id as match_id, g.* " +
            "FROM games_teams AS gt " +
            "INNER JOIN games g ON gt.match_id = g.id " +
            "INNER JOIN team t ON gt.teams_id = t.id " +
            "WHERE t.name=?1 OR t.name=?2 " +
            "GROUP BY g.id " +
            "HAVING count(g.id)>1 " +
            ") AS joinned_table " +
            ") m ON tm.matches_id = m.id " +
            "WHERE NOT played and t.name = ?3 ",
            nativeQuery = true)
    Optional<Match> findIdByTeamsNameAndTournamentName(String t1, String t2, String tName);
  ```
